## RESTful
RESTful APIs adhere to the principles of REST, which includes:
* Client-Server Architecture: 
    - Client: making requests
    - Server:  processing requests and sending responses back
* Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to fulfill the request. The server does not maintain any client state between requests
* Resource-Based: A resource is any object or entity that can be accessed or manipulated over the network. Normally ***represented by JSON/XML*** format and identified by URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
* RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
